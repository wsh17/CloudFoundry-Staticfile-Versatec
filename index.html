  <br>

  </font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the STAR became known within Xerox's Engineering community as a workstation with bit-mapped 

    graphics, a mouse, menus, and icons.&nbsp; There was </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">one group called <b>Xerox's E.I.S.

group</b>, who took the STAR platform and developed several CAD/CAM packages for it. The

<b>Xerox E.I.S.</b> group under a re-organization was to report in to a Xerox subsidiary called <b><i>Versatec</i></b>. &nbsp;Versatec was know mostly for their great eletrostatic plotters

that were used on large CAD/CAD systems, like <a href="http://www.intergraph.com/">Intergraph</a>, <a href="calma-cadsystem.jpg">Calma</a>, Computer Vision,</font><big><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><big> <a href="http://www.tech-illustrator.com/">Auto-trol</a>,</big></font></big><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <big><a href="http://www.ugs.com/products/nx/">Unigraphics</a>,</big>&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <a href="cadam.jpg">Cadem</a>, <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/applications/plm/catiav5/">Catia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZIX">Daisy</a>, <a href="http://www.mentor.com">Mentor</a>, <a href="http://www.cadence.com/">ECAD</a>, <a href="http://www.cadence.com/">SDA</a>, <a href="http://www.cadence.com/">Cadence</a>, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com">AutoCad</a>, and many many others, so the match seem like natural fit. &nbsp;Most of the CAD

systems sold at the time were <i><b>"turn key"</b></i>

so when you bought &nbsp;a system you pretty much got everything, from the computer

hardware, to the CAD software, down to the <a href="7000-plotter.jpg">plotter</a>.&nbsp; A good history of CAD can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://mbinfo.mbdesign.net/CAD-History.htm"> http://mbinfo.mbdesign.net/CAD-History.htm</a></font> .<br>

The Versatec E.I.S. Expert was Announced to the <a href="versatec-Expert-launch.jpg">Market Place in 1984</a> with CAD tools

for Drafting (Expert Drafting) and Drawing (Expert Illustrator).

At the <a href="http://www.dac.com/42nd/index.html">Design Automation Conference (DAC)</a> in June of 1985 the<a href="EDA-Pkg.jpg"> Expert Engineer package</a>

was added to the product to support Electronics' design automation

(EDA) market.&nbsp; As with the Star, this product never really took

off in the market, and the organizational match within Xerox put

Versatec at odds with all of its major OEM's.&nbsp; It was dis-continued in about&nbsp; 1988.&nbsp;  </font><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By comparison most other CAD system

environments at the time were basic and did not have the advanced windowing

and networking capabilities as the Xerox Expert did. &nbsp;I don't think

many customers really understood the value of a networked CAD workstation. &nbsp;

Not until the mid to late 80's did companies like&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href="www.hp.com" eda-pkg.jpg="">Apollo Computer</a>, <a href="www.hp.com">HP</a> and even the <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM </a>began

making cost effective networked workstations that these <a href="http://www.tenlinks.com/CAD/MCAD/">CAD vendors</a>

could port their software to. &nbsp; Sun lead the way with built in TCP/IP and a basic core belief that <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">"The Network was the Computer".&nbsp; </span>The days of turnkey CAD systems went away, a better cheep way became available.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span>And of course there is the whole <a href="http://www.idemployee.id.tue.nl/g.w.m.rauterberg/presentations/HCI-history/sld032.htm">IBM x86 PC story</a>.&nbsp; <br>
